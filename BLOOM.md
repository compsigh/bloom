# BLOOM

- Trailer: IRL val champs style cinematic with top teams from DEPLOY/24 "come take the crown" type shit
- DEMONS OTG trailer music
- Metal, flowers, Vyse type shit, hard rock, Spring vibes, Far Cry New Dawn type shit

Two aesthetic directions for BLOOM:

- current aggressive metal theme
- alternative Spring-like, à la Cuphead, Super Paper Mario pixel world, etc. more cheery

See Apple Notes for logo idea

- Campaign
  - Free yourself from AI slop
  - A return to form
  - The hackathon for the arts & sciences
    - Dramatically expand the net of people that can attend — basically all students in CAS
  - Art/design: Great Wave (+ other famous artworks) bitmapped
  - Artwork by Ray (Instagram)
- Trailer/explainer
  - Invite our friends who are doing both CS and something else that's interesting
    - Faadil
    - Sanju
  - People put CS and the work that we do in a box. Not everything has to be an app. Certainly not everything has to be AI. Research papers. Discovering a bug; making an open-source contribution. And what happens when we intersect with humanities? Documentaries. Music. Our potential is a lot greater than we give ourselves credit for.
  - À la MasterClass almost lol
- Platform
  - Idea generator — e.g. (a documentary) about (a local SF startup)
  - Team queue (especially good for cross-major connection)
  - Toolbox — basically the page with the same name from Edward's site + an expanded version of DEPLOY Resources section that includes tools, how-tos, and other fun things
