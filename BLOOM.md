## Web platform

Domains in consideration:

- bloom.build
- bloomhack.com
- bloom.compsigh.club

Notes:

- Idea generator — e.g. (a documentary) about (a local SF startup)
- Team queue (especially good for cross-major connection)
- Toolbox — basically the page with the same name from Edward's site + an expanded version of DEPLOY Resources section that includes tools, how-tos, and other fun things

## Keynote

## Merch

## Links

- [BLOOM Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/aEMV4laiF3RSIgap6rEm9N/BLOOM?node-id=0-1&t=YoPXAadOkMRuwyta-1)

## Notes

### Aesthetic direction

- Metal, flowers, Vyse type shit, hard rock, Spring vibes, Far Cry New Dawn type shit
- alternative Spring-like, à la Cuphead, Super Paper Mario pixel world, etc. more cheery

### Poster campaign

- Free yourself from AI slop
- A return to form
- The hackathon for the arts & sciences
    - Dramatically expand the net of people that can attend — basically all students in CAS
- Art/design: Great Wave (+ other famous artworks) bitmapped
- Artwork by Ray (Instagram)

### Trailer

We're not doing one, but here are the notes from brainstorming:

- Hype trailer
    - IRL val champs style cinematic with top teams from DEPLOY/24 "come take the crown" type shit
    - DEMONS OTG trailer music
- Explainer trailer
    - Invite our friends who are doing both CS and something else that's interesting
        - Faadil
        - Sanju
    - People put CS and the work that we do in a box. Not everything has to be an app. Certainly not everything has to be AI. Research papers. Discovering a bug; making an open-source contribution. And what happens when we intersect with humanities? Documentaries. Music. Our potential is a lot greater than we give ourselves credit for.
    - À la MasterClass almost lol
